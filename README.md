# Multi-Timer: Countdown Timers
An iOS app that allows you to run multiple timers at once! [Check it out on the iOS App Store!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multi-timer-countdown-timers/id1547154274#?platform=iphone)

* Straight forward, user-friendly UI
* Add and run up to eight timers with no extra screens, and with minimal clicks
* Customizable labels to easily keep track of each timer
* Sends notifications when each timer is complete, even when the app is minimized

Unlike similar apps, Multi-Timer's streamlined user interface contains no bloatware or in-app purchases - get your timers up and running with minimal clicks. 
Ideal for cooking, workouts, studying, games, and more!

## Showcase

This project was my first experience with developing a complete application end-to-end, in any programming language. The following is a list of concepts that I learned:

* Swift, Xcode
* MVC Architecture
* OOP
* TableView, CustomViewCells, SwipeGestures
* Local notifications
* Major Code/architecture refactoring

## Next Steps/Improvements

* General clean up of code
* Improve documentation/comments
* Further modularize code through implementing reusable functions
* Consider refactoring to MVVM
* Implement single system timer to keep track of all Timers, instead of multiple system timers
